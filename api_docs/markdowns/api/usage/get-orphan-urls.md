# Get Orphan URLs

Orphan URLs are URLs which are **not in your website structure** (or in the scope of your crawl) but which [received visits](#google-analytics-orphan-urls) or were [crawled by a search engine](#search-engines-crawl-orphan-urls).


## Google Analytics Orphan URLs

### Get count

To get the number of Orphan URLs which recevied either organic or social visits (according to Google Analytics), you have to request the main analysis data using [[getAnalysisSummary;reference#/Analysis/getAnalysisSummary]].

- Operation: [[getAnalysisSummary;reference#/Analysis/getAnalysisSummary]]
- Path: `analyses/{username}/{project_slug}/{analysis_slug}`
- HTTP Verb: GET
- Response: `Analysis`

```SH
curl 'https://api.botify.com/v1/analyses/${username}/${project_slug}/${analysis_slug}' \
     -X GET \
     -H 'Authorization: Token ${API_KEY}' \
     -H 'Content-type: application/json'
```

An extract of the response could be:

```JSON
{
  "features": {
    "ganalytics": {
      "ganalytics_site_id": 111513424,
      "date_start": "2016-02-08",
      "date_end": "2016-03-09",
      "sampled": true,
      "sample_size": 30227156,
      "sample_percent": "72.89999999999999",
      "unknown": {
        "organic": {
          "all": {
            "nb_urls": 1390,
            "nb_visits": 438020
          },
          "google": {
            "nb_urls": 1334,
            "nb_visits": 437022
          },
          "bing": {
            "nb_urls": 36,
            "nb_visits": 221
          },
          "baidu": {
            "nb_urls": 1,
            "nb_visits": 2
          },
          ...
        },
        "social": {
          "all": {
            "nb_urls": 1241,
            "nb_visits": 54604
          },
          "facebook": {
            "nb_urls": 300,
            "nb_visits": 38437
          },
          "twitter": {
            "nb_urls": 48,
            "nb_visits": 525
          },
          ...
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So for instance the number of Google visits generated by URLs which were not crawled can be found at `features.ganalytics.unknown.organic.google.nb_visits`.



### Get sample of Orphan URLs

- Operation: [[getGanalyticsOrphanURLs;reference#/Analysis/getGanalyticsOrphanURLs]]
- Path: `analyses/{username}/{project_slug}/{analysis_slug}/features/ganalytics/orphan_urls/{medium}/{source}`
- HTTP Verb: GET
- Response: `Pagination<OrphanURL>`

```SH
curl 'https://api.botify.com/v1/analyses/{username}/{project_slug}/{analysis_slug}/features/ganalytics/orphan_urls/{medium}/{source}' \
     -X GET \
     -H 'Authorization: Token ${API_KEY}' \
     -H 'Content-type: application/json'
```

The response could be the following. You can at most get a sample of 1000 orphan URLs. The second number for each URL is the total number of visits.

```JSON
{
  "count": 1000,
  "page": 1,
  "size": 100,
  "results": [
    [
      "http://example.domain.com/2016/02/103982/fuller-house-season-one",
      "55986"
    ],
    [
      "http://example2.domain.com",
      "23888"
    ],
    [
      "http://example2.domain.com/2016/02/104206/oscars-2016-stacey-dash",
      "22319"
    ],
    [
      "http://example.domain.com/2016/03/104051/republican-primary-winners-election-results-2016",
      "13636"
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Search Engines' Crawl Orphan URLs

Search engines' crawl orphan URLs are shown in the following chart avalaible in the Search Engines tab of the Botify Analytics report. Indeed, orphan URLs are the URLs only crawled by Google/Bing (the red part).

### Get count

To get the number of Orphan URLs which were crawled by a search engine (according to your logs), you have to request the main analysis data using [[getAnalysisSummary;reference#/Analysis/getAnalysisSummary]].

- Operation: [[getAnalysisSummary;reference#/Analysis/getAnalysisSummary]]
- Path: `analyses/{username}/{project_slug}/{analysis_slug}`
- HTTP Verb: GET
- Response: `Analysis`

```SH
curl 'https://api.botify.com/v1/analyses/${username}/${project_slug}/${analysis_slug}' \
     -X GET \
     -H 'Authorization: Token ${API_KEY}' \
     -H 'Content-type: application/json'
```

An extract of the reponse could be :
```JSON
{
  "features": {
    "search_engines": {
      "date_start": "2016-02-08",
      "date_end": "2016-03-09",
      "orphans": {
        "total": 1931796,
        "crawls": {
          "bing": {
            "bots": {
              "search": 518546
            },
            "total": 518546
          },
          "total": 1735262,
          "google": {
            "bots": {
              "search": 443855,
              "smartphone": 79227,
              "other": 686192,
              "ads": 7442
            },
            "total": 1216716
          }
        },
        "visits": {
          "bing": 79135,
          "total": 196534,
          "google": 117399
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So for instance the number of total number of orphans URLs for Google can be found at `features.ganalytics.unknown.organic.google.nb_visits`.



### Get Orphan URLs

**Not available yet.**
You can't get the list of orphan URLs yet, which explains why you can't click on the red part in the Botify Analytics Application.
Be noticed that we are developing a way to query these orphan URLs.
