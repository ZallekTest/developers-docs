# Search Engines

Search Engines are data retreived from your server logs. It's firstly used to compute the number of crawls by search engine by URL and therefore if an URL is kwown by a given search engine or not. Plus, it's also used to compute visits. This data is mainly used for the **Search Engines** tab of Botify Analytics Report.

It also introduce Search Engines orphan URLs which are URLs **not in your website structure** (or in the scope of your crawl) but which were crawled by a search engine. Search engines' crawl orphan URLs are shown in the following chart (the red part) avalaible in the Search Engines tab of the Botify Analytics report.

## Get metadata

Google Analytics feature metadata includes:
- imported **data timeframe**.
- **orphans URLs counts**.

### Request

- Operation: [[getAnalysisSummary;reference#/Analysis/getAnalysisSummary]]
- Path: `analyses/{username}/{project_slug}/{analysis_slug}`
- HTTP Verb: GET
- Response: `Analysis`

```SH
curl 'https://api.botify.com/v1/analyses/${username}/${project_slug}/${analysis_slug}' \
     -X GET \
     -H 'Authorization: Token ${API_KEY}' \
     -H 'Content-type: application/json'
```

### Response

An extract of the reponse could be the following.
**Note:** If feature is not enabled, `features.search_engines` resolves to `null`.

In the response, you can find the imported logs timeframe with `date_start` and `date_end` properties.
Plus, you can get orphan URLs count with the `orphans` property. For instance, the number of orphan URLs for Google crawl can be found at `features.search_engines.orphans.crawls.google.total`; and the total number of visits generated by those URLs at `features.search_engines.orphans.visits.google`.

## Get Orphan URLs

**Not available yet.**
You can't get the list of orphan URLs yet, which explains why you can't click on the red part in the Botify Analytics Application.
Be noticed that we are developing a way to query these orphan URLs.
