# Project

Project is the basic container for a website analysis. Think of it as a folder.

- A analysis is started in a project, and the next analysis started in this project will have its results automatically compared to the previous analysis' results.
- Repeat analyses are scheduled within a project.

Through the API, possibilities on projects are quite limited for now. We are planning to allow you to launch crawls and modify your project settings. A complete list of operations can be found in the **[[reference;reference#/Project]]**.

- [[List your projects;project-list-projects]]
